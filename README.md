This package let's you launch an execution context for R so you can run R code from within your Stencila Document or Sheet.

### Install

Right now this package isn't on CRAN, but you can install it from this repo using the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package,

```r
devtools::install_github("stencila/r")
```

### Use

```r
# Load the library
library(stencila)

# Start the Stencila R host so that it can respond to 
# external requests to create and call execution contexts
host$start()
```

Unit tests live in the `tests` folder and are mostly written using `testthat`. Documentation is written using `roxygen2` and the documentation site is generated by `pkgdown` into the [`docs`](docs) folder.

### Install

This package isn't on CRAN yet, but you can install it from this repository using the [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package,

```r
devtools::install_github("stencila/r")
```

### Use

This package lets you run R code from inside Stencila Documents. First, you need to start serving the Stencila Host within this package. You can do that in your favourite R console (e.g. RStudio):

```r
stencila:::start()
```

Or at the system shell:

```sh
RScript -e 'stencila::run()'
```

Then, open your Stencila Document from within the [Stencila Desktop](https://github.com/stencila/desktop). The host will be automatically detected by the dektop app and you'll be able to execute R code cells from within your documents.

More documentation is available at https://stencila.github.io/r
